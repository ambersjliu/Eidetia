Eidetia is a 3D Unity maze game like any otherâ€“except it isn't, because in what other maze game do you have to fend off evil tomato-throwing bears by shining a flashlight on them?!
Features:

- A flashlight mechanic where the battery drains over time, affecting both brightness and damage output by the player
- A health and flashlight battery refill system
- Bears that throw HP-draining tomatoes with decent accuracy
- A timer
- A creepy soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gC6jt7aueE

This is my first time uploading a Unity game to GitHub; as such, I'm not sure if the project files will work or not upon downloading.
Included is a zipped Game folder, where the .exe for the game is located. Have fun!
